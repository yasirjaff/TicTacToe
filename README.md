This code is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java Swing for the GUI (Graphical User Interface). Let me break down the code and explain its main components:

   - The code begins with import statements to import necessary Java libraries.

   - The class `TicTacToe` is declared.

   - Various instance variables are declared, including dimensions for the game board and GUI components such as `JFrame`, `JLabel`, `JPanel`, and `JButton`.
   - `board` is a 2D array of `JButton` representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
   - Strings `playerX`, `playerO`, and `currentPlayer` represent the symbols for players X and O, and the current player respectively.
   - `gameOver` is a boolean flag indicating whether the game has ended.
   - `turns` tracks the number of turns played.

   - The `checkWinner` method checks for a winner after each move.
   - It checks for winning conditions horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
   - If a winner is found, the corresponding buttons are highlighted, and the game over flag is set.
   - If no winner is found after 9 turns, the game is declared a tie.
